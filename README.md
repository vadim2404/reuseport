# SO_REUSEPORT Example

This is an experiment of graceful shutdown.

Situation:

We have `N` (`N > 1`) servers that provide some API via TCP. And we want to release the new version of this API. On other hand, we don't want to disconnect current active sessions.

What's the idea?

1. Create 2+ listeners that shares the same port.
1. Listeners handles a SIGHUP
1. On receiving such signal, listener stops accepting new clients and waits until existing clients finish their work.


```bash
console-1 > cargo run
Process 62656 running
Process 62656 listening on: 127.0.0.1:8080

console-2 > cargo run
Process 66623 running
Process 66623 listening on: 127.0.0.1:8080

console-3 > telnet 127.0.0.1 8080
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'
